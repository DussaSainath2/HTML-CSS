                       <center> <img src="D:\Springboot ass\html\images\html.jpg" alt="html1"><br></center>
                        <p>HyperText Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. 
                            It defines the content and structure of web content. It is often assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.
                            Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. 
                            HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for its appearance.
                            HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages.
                             With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, 
                             paragraphs, lists, links, quotes, and other items. HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. 
                            HTML can embed programs written in a scripting language such as JavaScript, which affects the behavior and content of web pages. 
                            [2] A form of HTML, known as HTML5, is used to display video and audio, primarily using the canvas element, together with JavaScript.</p>

                        <h2 align="center">CSS</h2>
                      <center>  <img src="D:\Springboot ass\html\images\css.jpeg" alt="html1"><br></center>
                        <p>CSS is designed to enable the separation of content and presentation, including layout, colors, and fonts.
                             This separation can improve content accessibility;[further explanation needed] provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics; enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .
                             css file, which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content; and enable the .
                             css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.
                            Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible to present the same markup page in different styles for different rendering methods, such as on-screen, in print, by voice (via speech-based browser or screen reader), and on Braille-based tactile devices. 
                            CSS also has rules for alternate formatting if the content is accessed on a mobile device.
                            The name cascading comes from the specified priority scheme to determine which declaration applies if more than one declaration of a property match a particular element.
                             This cascading priority scheme is predictable.
                            The CSS specifications are maintained by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).
                             Internet media type (MIME type) text/css is registered for use with CSS by RFC 2318 (March 1998). 
                             The W3C operates a free CSS validation service for CSS documents.[5]
                            In addition to HTML, other markup languages support the use of CSS including XHTML, plain XML, SVG, and XUL. CSS is also used in the GTK widget toolkit.</p>

                        <p>JavaScript is the most powerful and versatile web programming language. 
                            It is used for making the websites interactive. JavaScript helps us add features like animations, interactive forms and dynamic content to web pages.
                            In this JavaScript Tutorial, we’ll learn all the basics to advanced topics and concepts of JavaScript. 
                            This JavaScript tutorial includes operators, control flow, functions, objects, Asynchronous JavaScript, Events, DOM manipulation, OOPs, Closures, Event loops etc.
                            What is JavaScript?
                            JavaScript is a programming language used for creating dynamic content on websites. It is a lightweight, cross-platform and single-threaded programming language.
                             JavaScript is an interpreted language that executes code line by line providing more flexibility.
                              It is a commonly used programming language to create dynamic and interactive elements in web applications. It is easy to learn.</p>

                        <p>jQuery is a lightweight open-source JavaScript library that simplifies manipulating the Document Object Model (DOM), handling events, and creating dynamic web experiences.
                            The main purpose of jQuery is to simplify the usage of JavaScript on websites.
                             jQuery simplifies complex JavaScript tasks with single-line methods, it makes your code more readable and maintainable.
                              By learning jQuery, you can significantly improve the interactivity and responsiveness of your web pages.
                            In this jQuery tutorial, you’ll learn all the basic to advanced concepts of jQuery such as DOM manipulation and event handling, AJAX, animations, plugins, etc.
                            DOM Manipulation: jQuery simplifies HTML DOM tree traversal and manipulation. You can easily select and modify elements on your web page.
                            Event Handling: Handling user interactions (such as clicks or mouse events) becomes straightforward with jQuery.
                            CSS Animations: You can create smooth animations and effects using jQuery.
                            AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML): jQuery simplifies making asynchronous requests to the server and handling responses.</p>

                        <p>AJAX tutorial covers concepts and examples of AJAX technology for beginners and professionals.
                            AJAX is an acronym for Asynchronous JavaScript and XML. 
                            It is a group of inter-related technologies like JavaScript, DOM, XML, HTML/XHTML, CSS, XMLHttpRequest etc.
                            AJAX allows you to send and receive data asynchronously without reloading the web page. So it is fast.
                            AJAX allows you to send only important information to the server not the entire page. So only valuable data from the client side is routed to the server side. 
                            It makes your application interactive and faster.
